Time Series Forecasting: ARIMA models

The South African Weather Service (SAWS) is a technology firm that specialises in providing services regarding weather, climate, and related products in South Africa. By enhancing observational data and communication networks to convert data into meaningful products and services for risk mitigation, advancing the science of meteorology and research. The SAWS research team is investigating the use of conventional and advanced machine learning technologies in predicting weather conditions. As a technical consultant for the company, you have been tasked with evaluating some ML techniques' performance to forecast daily minimum temperatures given historical data. (“saws_time_series_datasets.csv”).

1.1.    Using R, preload the SAWS datasets in the scientific environment and provide a plot for the time series.  

(6 marks)

1.2.    Divide your datasets into training and test sets in a proportion of 20/80 and build an ARIMA (p,d,q) model for daily minimum temperature forecasting. Estimate the best model orders using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or AIC corrected.   

(15 marks)

1.3.    Provide two time-series plots of the training set and test set, including the forecasted models, and provide the mean sum of squares error estimates for both forecasts.
